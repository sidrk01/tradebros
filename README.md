## Project Description
### Inspiration
Many novice investors start their personal investment journey by opening a brokerage account. Although many of these investment websites provide some knowledge, many retail investors can feel overwhelmed by the numerous terminology and strategies. Trade bros is a website that seeks to help ease retail investors into the market. More often than not, a lot of these novice investors end up losing tons of money. They end up buying stocks that do not have good fundamentals or do not do their due diligence in researching news on a stock before they buy it. This can easily lead to a loss of potential profit from a lack of knowledge in possible areas of investment. Although there are other websites that do some sort of knowledge building, we are more geared toward helping out novice investors to get themselves on the right track right away. In turn, this will save them time and money on finding and purchasing resources to help them. Our website will make it easy to learn and grow for novice investors on their beginning journey.

### Overview
Trade bros is a website that displays and tracks various US stocks. The website features an interactive UI that allows users to view and search for publicly traded stocks, indices, and tech sectors. It also includes a full guide on how to trade stocks and options as well as features a watchlist where users can enter stocks that they are interested in. Furthermore, it will allow users to create an account and log in so they can build a virtual portfolio so they can keep track of their holdings whenever they want.
